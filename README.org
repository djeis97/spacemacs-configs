#+TITLE: My Spacemacs Layers/Themes Collection

This repository contains all of the custom layers and themes that I use in my
various configs. The toplevel themes and layers directories are meant to be
added to the proper spacemacs lists (I actually symlink them directly to my
.spacemacs.d directory).
