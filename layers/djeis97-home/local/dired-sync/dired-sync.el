;;; History:
;;
;;  * 0.3 - Add dired-do-sync-pool (thanks to ryukzak)
;;
;;  * 0.2 - Fix ssh commands.
;;
;;  * 0.1 - first release

;;; TODO
;;  * move both rsync / ssh commands to variables.

;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; dired-sync provide a simple and easy way to synchronize directories from
;; dired. This tool is based upon both rsync(1) and ssh(1).
;;
;; To install `dired-sync' you simply need to drop dired-sync.el in your
;; load-path and bind (suggested) C-s S key to `dired-do-sync':
;;
;; (when (require 'dired-sync nil t)
;;   (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c S") 'dired-do-sync))
;;
;; Synchronizations can also be done using pools (seed `dired-do-sync-pool'.
;; For this to work `dired-sync-pools' needs to be configured. To bind
;; `dired-do-sync-pool' to C-c s add this in previous sexp:
;;
;; (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "C-c s") 'dired-do-sync-pool)
;;
;; There are 3 types of directories synchronizations as explained bellow.
;;
;; * local / local
;;   This is the easiest way. rsync(1) would be enough.
;;
;; * local / remote or remote / local
;;   This is also a simple way, the only requirement is a working ssh
;;   connection to the remote host.
;;
;; * remote / remote
;;   This is a bit more complexe since there are 3 types of remote / remote
;;   syncs.
;;   - source server can reach destination server
;;     In that case `dired-sync' would optimize files synchronisation by
;;     running rsync(1) on the source server through a ssh connection.
;;   - source server cannot reach destination server
;;     This is the more complexe case. `dired-sync' would create a ssh
;;     tunnel from source to destination using your local machine as a
;;     jumphost.
;;     Be aware this mode is greedy regarding bandwidth consumption since
;;     data are transfered twice: from the source server to localhost AND
;;     from localhost to destination server.
;;   - Both source and destination are located on the same remote host.
;;     This case is the same as the first one (source server can reach
;;     destination server) except the destination directory is local (on the
;;     remote host).
;;  If a direct connection could not be established from source to
;;  destination, `dired-sync' would automatically fall back to the tunneled
;;  sync mode.
;;
;;  `dired-sync' is heavily based on ssh(1) configuration hence your
;;  ~/.ssh/config file should be as accurate as possible. It doesn't matter
;;  how many jumphosts you need to use to reach both source and destination
;;  as long as they are declared in you ssh configuration file.
;;
;;  To allow `dired-sync' to work out of the box, key-based ssh
;;  authentication is required.
;;
;;      Source                       Destination
;;
;;    +---------+   (if possible)    +---------+
;;    |  HostA  |<- - - - - - - - - >|  HostB  |
;;    |  UserA  |                    |  UserB  |
;;    +---------+                    +---------+

;;    +---------+                    +---------+

;; To use that configuration, you ~/.ssh/config may be something like:
;;
;;   Host *
;;        ForwardAgent yes
;;        RhostsRSAAuthentication yes
;;        RSAAuthentication yes
;;        HashKnownHosts yes
;;        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
;;        TCPKeepAlive yes
;;        ServerAliveInterval 30
;;        Port 22
;;        Protocol 2,1
;;
;;   Host jumphostA
;;        User userJHA
;;        HostName jumphostA.example.com
;;
;;   Host hostA
;;        User userA
;;        HostName jumphostA.internal.example.com
;;        ProxyCommand ssh -q -t jumphostA  nc -w 1 %h %p
;;
;;   Host jumphostB
;;        User userJHB
;;        HostName jumphostB.other-example.com
;;
;;   Host hostB
;;        User userB
;;        HostName jumphostV.internal.other-example.com
;;        ProxyCommand ssh -q -t jumphostB  nc -w 1 %h %p
;;
;;
;; then you would be able to connect to hostA by simply typing:
;;
;;    ssh hostA
;;
;; Or opening a dired buffer to hostB: C-X C-f /scp:hostB:

Function are called with 2 parameters SRC and DST as return by
`dired-sync-parse-uri' suitable for `dired-sync-with-files'
macro.

:get-user-local

  Shell function to be used to retrieve local username. Please
  note that local is relative to source host.
  Should return a string evaluated by `shell-command'.

:get-user-remote

  Shell function to be used to retrieve remote username from
  source host. This function is used to check source-destination
  connectivity.
  Should return a string evaluated by `shell-command'.

:do-sync-local-local

  Shell function to be used to synchronize two local directories.
  This function should return a list of 2 items suitable for
  `start-process'.

  Generally the first element of the list is a list containing
  full rsync parameters. The second element should be nil.


:do-sync-local-remote

  Shell function to be used to synchronize local directory to a
  remote one. Like ::do-sync-local-local This function should
  return a list of 2 items suitable for `start-process'.

  Generally the first element of the list is a list containing
  full rsync parameters. The second element should be nil.

:do-sync-remote-local

  Same as :do-sync-local-remote but in a reverse way.

:do-sync-remote-remote-direct

  Shell function to be used to synchronize two remote
  directories. This is used then source host can connect to
  destination host. This function should return a list of 2 items
  suitable for `start-process'.

  Generally the first element of the list is a list containing
  full rsync parameters. The second element should be nil.

::do-sync-remote-remote-same

  Shell function to be used to synchronize two remote directories
  on the same host.This function should return a list of 2 items
  suitable for `start-process'.

  Generally the first element of the list is a list containing
  full rsync parameters. The second element should be nil.

:do-sync-remote-remote

  Shell function to be used to synchronize two remote
  directories. This is used when source host cannot connect to
  destination host. This function should return a list of 2
  items suitable for `start-process'.

  Generally the first element of the list is a list containing
  ssh tunnel setup from local host to destination host, second
  element should contain the rsync command from source host to
  destination using local host as a ssh tunnel gateway."
